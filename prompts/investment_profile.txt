## Investment Criteria

### Must Have
- Market cap >$1B (prefer >$10B for liquidity)
- Positive revenue growth
- Earnings date within next {{DAYS_AHEAD}} days

## Research Priorities

### 1. Fundamental Strength (Most Important)
- Revenue growth sustainability (is growth accelerating, stable, or decelerating?)
- Margin health (expanding or sustainably high)
- Cash generation (FCF margin, ROIC)
- Balance sheet quality (low debt, strong cash position)

### 2. Competitive Moat
- Pricing power (can they raise prices without losing customers?)
- Switching costs (how hard is it for customers to leave?)
- Network effects (does value increase with more users?)
- Market share and position

### 3. Growth Durability
- TAM expansion (total addressable market growing?)
- Product/service differentiation
- Competitive threats (who could disrupt them?)
- Management track record

### 4. Secular Tailwinds
- AI/ML infrastructure buildout
- Cloud adoption and migration
- Digital transformation trends
- Enterprise software consolidation

### 5. Valuation
- PEG ratio (P/E to growth rate ratio)
- Does growth justify premium multiples?
- Relative valuation vs sector peers

## Investment Thesis Template

For each stock, draft a concise thesis (2-3 sentences) that answers:
1. Why are the fundamentals strong?
2. What secular trend benefits this company?
3. What competitive advantage is durable over 3-12 months?

Example:
"NVIDIA dominates the datacenter GPU market with 90%+ share and significant
switching costs from CUDA ecosystem. Positioned to benefit from multi-year AI
infrastructure buildout with strong pricing power. Blackwell architecture
extends margin and performance leadership through 2026."

## Risk Assessment

Always identify 3-5 specific risks:
- Competitive threats (new entrants, alternatives)
- Valuation concerns (high multiples, expectations)
- Execution risks (product delays, customer concentration)
- Macro headwinds (spending cuts, recession)
- Regulatory/political risks
